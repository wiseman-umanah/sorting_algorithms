## 0. Bubble sort
`mandatory`

> Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

- Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
- Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

  in the best case
  in the average case
  in the worst case

`mandatory`

> Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
> Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
> You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
> You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
> Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
  - in the best case
  - in the average case
  - in the worst case
